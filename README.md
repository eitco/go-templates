### What it is
As a Developer, one might want to bootstrap various types of application and/or project structures based upon different needs.

Templates within this repository may be more like a base structure to start-off.

## How to use this repository

[Experimenting with project templates](https://go.dev/blog/gonew).

Otherwise:

- Install gonew: `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gonew@latest`
